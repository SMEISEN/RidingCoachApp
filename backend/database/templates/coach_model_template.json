Ninety-nine percent of suspension issue though these overlap. Ninety-nine percent of the time the tuner/rider drops the front end (raises the fork tubes in the triple clamps) in an attempt to cure this. His thinking is typically one of two things: either he's trying to 'weight the front end' or he is trying to decrease trail Does dropping the front end weight the front end? Yes, but not so much as you'd notice it. This is a common misconception. As to decreasing the trail—the reason you'd want to decrease trail is because it is too difficult to turn the bars. If there is a lack of traction, you'd want to go the other way—increase the trail. Along with an increase in trail generally comes an increase in traction (grip). So, begin by asking the question:",
